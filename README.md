# GAIA-DRL

This repository contains experimental data and code for the paper:  
**GAIA-DRL: A Geoenvironmental Agent for Energy Optimization in Batteryless IoT Networks with Ambient Backscatter**

## Structure

- `colab_notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter notebook for training
- `omnetpp_simulation/`: Network simulation models in OMNeT++
- `data/`: NDVI and Vt input data used for training
- `figures/`: All figures used in the paper

## How to Reproduce

1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt or Colab
2. Run the notebook inside `/colab_notebooks/`
3. Use the `.ini` and `.ned` files in OMNeT++ for baseline data
